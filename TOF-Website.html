            <h1>What We Do</h1>
            <p>Our programs are focused on helping underrepresented high school
                students in STEM pursue and afford educations of the highest quality. To do
                this, students will need a large skillset, including critical thinking,
                problem solving, logic, adaptability, and more! By engaging in our programs,
                our goal is to equip our students with one or more of these skills to their
                tool belt so that they can chase their dreams. Our official list of programs include:

            <p>
                Students in this program receive personal laptops, personal ACT tutoring,
                college counseling, and coding skills via project-based learning.
